Week 2:
To start implementing and building our project we had to learning MERN stack basics and structures, I watched tutorials, and started to code the backend.  

Week 3:
I continued learning MERN stack and started with the frontend parts. After I and the rest of the group finished the tutorials and had learned the basics we branched by feature and started construct the frontend. 

I worked on the design of "Matcher" page on the webside and coded the start of ”Match Information” component which shows the current catch inforamtion like: the teams facing eachother, the score, club logos. I also created three empty tab components that will show the teams lineup, match events, and the league table. 


I also worked on a component that would show the upcomming, present, and future maches, but it got scrapped for a better variation.
