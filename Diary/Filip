week 1: We began with discussing about what project we would like to create. After the we decided what we want to do we started planning and tried to divided work equally to make things more smoothly and effecient. 

week 2: we created a git repo and started to write down what basic features(also "future" features we would problably like to have) we want and plan more thoroughly. We also drew the website more and the routes and pages we planned to use. We also decided to watch a 4 hour tutorial on MERN stack to make sure that we all had the same basic understanding on how things work and how we want to implement things.

week 3: We start testing and play around with all the tools such as react, mongodb, css etc. to learn more and to get a better understanding on the semantics and functionallity and how we can build our website with it.

Me personally started by designing and implementing the websiteâ€™s navigation bar

week 4: I worked on developing the match detail section, i created a tab navigation system which contained match facts,lineups, table, scoreboard etc.

In the match facts tab i implemented a timeline view to display match events such as goals, cards, assists, and substitutions. I created some Mockdata to see how it would look like. The timeline was designed with a clean and structured layout, including key milestones like half-time and full-time. I also worked on improving the user interface

In the lineups tab i implement an image of a football field which consist of players of both the home-team and the away-team with diffrent formations and roles. When you hover over the player you would get the information of the player and when a specific match is selected the lineup view updates based on that specific match.
