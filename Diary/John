week 1: We started discussing our idea för the project and started sketching ideas on how the application should look like.

week 2: Now we started creating our git repositiory and started to develop a plan that fits everyone for the project. We also started to design the look of the website further with all the pages and different functions that we need. To manage all this we decided to watch a 4 hour long youtube turtorial to cover all part regarding the database, react, etc.

week 3: This week all group members have watched the turtorial video and started coding. We have created the database with mongodb and started to play around with react to be comfortable with the enviorment. The group also decieded to split responsibilites so that we could divide the work and work on our own.

week 4: I started working on the NewsPage and HomePage part of the application, where i sat the deadline to be done on Wednesday because my group had project demonstration on the day after. I managed this deadline and got deeper understanding for css and react. Now the next part for me is the competion page.

week 5: I have worked with the CompetitionPage with both the design and the database. I started first by using some dummy data to visualize how the design would look and change some components after that. For next week the whole group will work togehter to finalize the project.

week 6: For this week i have worked with the admin Club-edit part of the application where the user can edit and create clubs. I also added a serachbar so the user can search for a specific club when the list get bigger with time. I have also connected this to the database and it works as planned. I also fixed some bugs with the CompetitionDetails page.

week 7: This week, I haven’t done much coding because the project turned out to be bigger than we anticipated. Instead, we focused on finishing the last part based on the feedback you gave our group
